//principles of JS:
//high level - hardware is not managed, low level ex. C - manage resources manually
//garbage collector - cleaning memory that we do not need
//Just-In-Time compilation, interpreted
//multi paradigm - approach of structuring code, coding style
//prototype based object-oriented
//first class functions
//dynamic - dynamically typed ex. let x = 23; let t = "Jonas";
//single-threaded
//non-blocking event loop

//JS Engine executes JS code, every browser has its own, V8 -> Chrome NodeJS
//Call Stack (references to objects) vs Heap (pool for objects)

//parsing - split and save it to tree AST to check for error
