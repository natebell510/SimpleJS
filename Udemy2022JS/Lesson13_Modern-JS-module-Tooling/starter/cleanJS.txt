clean and modern java script practices
- readable
- understandable in 1 year
- descriptive variable names, functions named by what they do

- function does one thing
- use default params
- return same data type as received
- use arrow functions when they make code more readable

- do not use var
- use strong type checks === !==


OOP
- use classes
- encapsulate data and do not mutate it from outside the class
- implement method chaining
- do use arrow functions as methods

- avoid callback based async APIs
- avoid loops, array and collection methods

- consume promises with async/await
- run promises in parallel Promise.all
- handle errors and promise rejections
